# Objectify

## purpose 
The goal of this project is to create a sharing and give-away app built on top of the NOSTR protocol.

Other services exist online for sharing goods between people:
- Olio    
- Facebook Marketplace
- even Instagram is used for some sales and give-aways

there are sure to be more examples. What they all have in common is that they are so called "walled gardens". The data that they create within their application ecosystem is not accessible from the outside. It is only accessible through their application interface.

NOSTR protocol provides a means of creating interoperable applications. A sharing and give-away platform is best suited in an ecosystem which is interoperable and open the way NOSTR is. This means that while our project can start defining good standards of use, other projects can start their own applications for their tailored use cases but following the same standards. This means that we can achieve true network effects while working on disparate applications, because we adhere to the same protocol and have access to the same data through relays.


## code
This application will make use of the NOSTR protocol.
